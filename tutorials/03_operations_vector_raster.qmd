```{r}
library(raster)
library(sf)
states <- read_sf('')
```

Use a shapefile to guide raster extraction per feature: temperature per state.

Then calculate averages and stuff

Modify the underlying feature structure of the shapefile:

-   Dissolve and union

-   Intersection and clip

What if I want to create a new shapefile from the one we have. Let's see the function buffer, and let's buffer the states.
